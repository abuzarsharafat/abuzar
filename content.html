        <h2>Convey with Words</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Creativity can emerge in many ways. Sometimes,
            it’s a simple starting point. It might be wise
            to reflect the times and a significant sentiment.
            These examples tap into beauty, memes, a health
            crisis, and a love of pets.</p>

            &emsp;&emsp;I was impressed with this line from Dove,
            “You’re more beautiful than you think.” It’s part
            of Dove Real Beauty Sketches, a six-minute YouTube
            video with 11 million views since 2013.
            The content looks at the gap between how we
            perceive ourselves and how others see us.</p>
